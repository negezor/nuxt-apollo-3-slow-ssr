# nuxt-apollo-3-slow-ssr

Demonstration of the problem when using the same queries in different components. But it works well if you make identical requests in the same component. Link to the [issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-apollo/issues/1222).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```
